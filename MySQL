/* Relationships */ 

- One-to-Many Relationships:- A product_category can have multiple products.
- A product can have multiple product_items and product_variations.
- A size_category can have multiple size_options.

- Many-to-One Relationships:- Each product_item belongs to one product_variation.
- Each product_variation links a single product, color, and size_option.

/* Data flow*/
Product Setup by Admin
- Admin uploads the product details to the product table, including:- product_name, brand_id, category_id, and base_price.

- Admin uploads image files or URLs to the product_image table linked to product_id.
- Admin assigns each product a category (product_category) and variations (product_variation table), such as size (size_option) and color (color).


Product Attributes Definition
- Admin creates custom attributes (e.g., material, weight) in the product_attribute table, linked to product_id.
- Attributes are grouped by category (attribute_category) and type (attribute_type) for ease of classification.


Customer Interaction with Products
- Browsing: Customers explore products by filtering them using the product_category, color, and size_option tables.
- Viewing Details: Once a product is selected, additional details like attributes, images, and available variations (size, color) are dynamically fetched from product_attribute, product_image, and product_variation.


Purchasing Workflow
- Customers select specific product items (product_item) based on chosen variations.
- Data flow from product_item ensures accurate pricing and inventory checks before purchase confirmation.


Seamless Integration of Entities
- Relationships: Primary keys and foreign keys in tables like product, product_variation, size_option, color, and brand ensure smooth data linking.
- Data Retrieval: Queries dynamically fetch interconnected data (e.g., product details with attributes, images, and variations).
